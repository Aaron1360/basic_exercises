Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by Raspberry Pi Ltd in association with Broadcom.
The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned toward the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools. The original model became more popular 
than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It is widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring, because of 
its low cost, modularity, and open design. It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists, due to its adoption of the HDMI and USB standards.

After the release of the second board type, the Raspberry Pi Foundation set up a new entity, named Raspberry Pi and installed Eben Upton as CEO, with the responsibility 
for developing their computers. The Foundation was rededicated as an educational charity for promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing 
countries. Most Raspberry Pis are made in a Sony factory in Pencoed, Wales, while others are made in China and Japan.

In 2015, the Raspberry Pi surpassed the ZX Spectrum in unit sales, becoming the best-selling British computer.

In 2021, Raspberry Pi Ltd changed its name to Raspberry Pi Ltd.
